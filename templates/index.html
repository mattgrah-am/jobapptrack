  <h3>Why keep track of job applications</h3>
  <p>Is record keeping necessary, especially if there is expectations to only apply for a few jobs. But the
    reality of the job market is people are applying for 10s if not 100s of positions before securing a new
    role. The reality of sending out many resumes before being invited to a job interview is quite real.
  </p>
  <p>If a recruiter or potential employer is in contact, being unprepared could result in elimination from their
    shortlist. If
    it's been a while and struggling to recall the organisation or job that was applied for, could be unprofessional and
    incompetent. However, if keeping track of job applications, access to the information can improve chances of being
    asked to interview.</p>
